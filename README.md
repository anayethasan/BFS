# BFS
Graph Traversal Algorithm
Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting all nodes (vertices) of a graph in a systematic manner. It is essential for solving various graph-related problems such as shortest path finding, connectivity checking, and network analysis.

Why is Graph Traversal Important?
Graph traversal helps in:

Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs
Analyzing connectivity in networks
Detecting cycles in graphs
Building recommendation systems
Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach
BFS explores a graph level by level, ensuring that all nodes at the current depth are visited before moving to the next level. It follows a queue-based approach, making it efficient for shortest path problems.

Applications of BFS
Shortest Distance Calculation Using BFS
Works efficiently on unweighted graphs
Calculates shortest distance from a single source
An efficient algorithm due to its O(V + E) complexity
Shortest Path Printing with BFS
Path Reconstruction: Tracks the shortest path from the source to the destination
Parent Tracking: Uses a parent array to backtrack the path
Efficient Path Printing: Ensures minimal steps in traversal
BFS Traversal Theory and Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(V + E) (V = vertices, E = edges)
Space Complexity: O(V) (for visited array and queue storage)
Graph Types and BFS Usage
Single-Source Shortest Distance Using BFS: Finds the shortest path from a given source to all reachable nodes
Bipartite Graph: BFS helps check whether a graph can be colored with two colors without adjacent nodes sharing the same color
Complete Graph: A graph where every pair of nodes is connected
DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): BFS is useful for topological sorting and shortest path calculation
Why Use an Adjacency List?
Efficient memory usage as it only stores existing edges
Fast traversal with O(V + E) complexity
Better for sparse graphs compared to adjacency matrices
